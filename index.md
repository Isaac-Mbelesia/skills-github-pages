# I AM ISAAC MBELESIA
I am a student at Tharaka Uni taking computer science.
---
I'm an enthusiastic computer science student, eager to soak up knowledge like a sponge. I spend my days attending lectures on data structures, algorithms, and programming languages, always with a keen interest in understanding the inner workings of technology. My nights are often filled with coding marathons in the computer lab, collaborating with classmates on exciting projects and solving complex problems.

I'm always on the lookout for opportunities to apply my skills in real-world scenarios, participating in hackathons, joining tech clubs, and seeking internships to gain hands-on experience. My professors and peers often see me as a reliable and innovative team player, ready to tackle challenges and contribute fresh ideas.

Outside of academics, I enjoy exploring the beautiful landscapes of Tharaka, engaging in community activities, and occasionally unwinding with friends over a cup of coffee at the local caf√©. Life as a computer science student at Tharaka University is a perfect blend of rigorous learning, personal growth, and unforgettable experiences.
